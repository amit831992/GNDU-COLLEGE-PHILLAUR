      <div class="message-pera"><p>Established in 1969, Guru Nanak Dev University is counted among the premiere institutions of higher education in India and is widely known for its excellence in teaching, research, sports as well as cultural activities. It is an honour to serve this institution as Dean, Academic affairs. In line with the provisions in the Guru Nanak Dev University Act 1969, the University has created provisions to impart education to promote teaching and research in all disciplines including Sciences, engineering and technology, life sciences, arts, social sciences, education, humanities, languages as well as religious studies and sports among others. The University has gained distinction in catering to the education needs of underprivileged society, especially in the rural areas. With 37 different Departments organized in ten different faculties, the University has regional campuses in Jalandhar, Gurdaspur, Fattu Dhingra and Sathiala, in addition to University colleges at Mukandpur, Jalandhar and Niari. Additionally, University has at least 11 constituent colleges located at different places in Punjab. The University has over 5000 students and more than 400 faculty members teaching different courses under the credit based continuous evaluation and grading system.

        The faculty of Guru Nanak Dev University have achieved visibility at national as well as international level, which is attested by the number of awards and distinctions they have received in their respective disciplines. Some of these awards include fellowships of all major societies of science, medicine and other disciplines, medals of national societies, lecture awards and other coveted distinctions in sports. In recognition of this, University Grants commission recently awarded status of University with potential for excellence in addition to accreditation by NAAC. Excellent placement record, availability of state-of-the-art facilities and teaching aids, this University offers immense opportunities to the perspective students.
        
        I am sure, under the leadership of the incumbent Vice-Chancellor, the University is well poised to make its mark internationally also.</p></div>
